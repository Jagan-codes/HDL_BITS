#HDL BITS ANSWERS#
This repository contains my solutions to the Verilog practice problems from the HDLBits website. With over **182** problems, it covers a wide range of digital design concepts such as logic gates, combinational circuits, sequential logic, and finite state machines (FSMs). Completing these challenges has greatly strengthened my understanding of digital electronics, RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, and hardware modeling. I hope this serves as a helpful reference for students, enthusiasts, and anyone preparing for roles in the VLSI domain or aiming to master Verilog HDL.
